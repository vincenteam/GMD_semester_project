inconsistent input, sometimes keypress is not registered (press and realse before Fixed update)

cant jump when on edges (feet are not touching the ground)

player cant move forward when going over transition between blocks even with no height difference

when switching direction with player animation go through idlestate
 
super booster appening randomly ?

super jump when moving and jumping simultaneously on superposed planes

unconsistent jump height when jumping on bodies

DONE player jumping when going over transition between blocks even with no height difference |  ??? generaly cleaner aregment of player colidders

DONE player stuck when trying to move in contact with a wall (can "grab" the wall mid jump) | reducing friction on the side of the player, and adding second a collider to handle friction with the ground

DONE infinite slide when taking boosters ? | adding friction

DONE randomly unable to jump seems to happen only on planes | putting "feets" to the player to have collision only with a flat surface and not with the capsule, making the ground detector exeed the limit of the player by a little bit (if too much can cause another bug by detecting the ground when still moving down which cancel the jump + let the player stuck on the ground) 

DONE animations played multiple times | triggers can stack -> resettrigger

DONE freez between jump animation and mid air animation hapenning from time to time | vanished after tweaking some transitions

DONE death fall animation happening mid air instead of falling on ground | bake into pose position and rotation of animation

DONE when dying, animation blink for a frame | making an independant animator controller and making sure to switch to the right animator controller before enabeling the object
