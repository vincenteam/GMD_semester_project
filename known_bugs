super booster appening randomly ?
DONE player stuck when trying to move in contact with a wall (can "grab" the wall mid jump) | reducing friction on the side of the player, and adding second a collider to handle friction with the ground
DONE infinite slide when taking boosters ? | adding friction
DONE randomly unable to jump seems to happen only on planes | putting "feets" to the player to have collision only with a flat surface and not with the capsule, making the ground detector exeed the limit of the player by a little bit (if too much can cause another bug by detecting the ground when still moving down which cancel the jump + let the player stuck on the ground) 
super jump when moving and jumping simultaneously on superposed planes
