# Game Development (GMD) - Semester project at VIA University College, Horsens

## Group Members :

BARDOU Vincent - student number 335129

NAEGELY Jeannot - student number 335140


## Context :

As French exchange students at VIA for a semester, we took part in the Game Development course, and we had to develop a game using Unity.
So, we made this.


## Game description :

Our game consists of the player trying to cross different levels.
Its main mechanic is the ability of the playable character (a robot) to kill himself and reappear into the same room, making him able to use his corpse to reach places he couldn't before.
Of course the game contains more than that, but that will be for you to discover (Or you can spoil yourself with the demonstration below).


## Demonstration of our game :

## How to play
- you cant :) ðŸ’€
- Final webGL build was too heavy to be put on git hub, and we couldn't get lfs to work, there is a very old build at https://vincenteam.github.io/GMD_semester_project/ that is from a previous version of the game and is not representative of the actual game, but demonstrate that it works. (you can play the first level and then you spawn in the tests scene that is demonstrating a nice bug on the sniper)
