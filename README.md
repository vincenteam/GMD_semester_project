## Group Members :

BARDOU Vincent - student number 335129

NAEGELY Jeannot - student number 335140


## Context :

As French exchange students at VIA for a semester, we took part in the Game Development course, and we had to develop a game using Unity.
So, we made this.


## How to run the game :

There are two ways for you to try the game.
The first one is by clicking on the following WebGL link to play it in your browser : [Insert WebGL build link here]
The second one requires you to be on Windows, and is you downloading the built game in /GMD_project_code/Builds


## Game description :

Our game consists of the player trying to cross different levels.
Its main mechanic is the ability of the playable character (a robot) to kill himself and reappear into the same room, making him able to use his corpse to reach places he couldn't before.
Of course the game contains more than that, but that will be for you to discover (Or you can spoil yourself with the demonstration below).
